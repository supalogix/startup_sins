\bigskip

This book contains depictions of complex and uncomfortable topics, including (but sadly 
not limited to) \textbf{childhood neglect}, \textbf{sexual trauma}, and \textbf{workplace 
trauma}. 

\medskip

The author has done his best to render these elements with realism, nuance, and empathy
while also acknowledging that the real world rarely offers trigger warnings before 
it screws you over.

\medskip

These scenes are not included lightly. They are here to model real-world social dynamics 
that are often 
invisible, denied, or wrapped in euphemism. In some cases, we kept it high-level. In others, 
we went a little deeper... because sometimes \textit{the devil really is in the details}.

\medskip

If the trauma gets loud, pause and listen to a soothing voice. Preferably not the one in 
your head that sounds like your mother.

\medskip

\textbf{\large If you’re one of the following, consider not even reading this book:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Healing from your own trauma and not in the mood to see it fictionalized.
  \item The type to get mad at the author for describing your coping strategy with such precision.
  \item Just here for a cute tech story with absolutely no moral ambiguity.
\end{itemize}

\medskip

Everyone else? Welcome. Buckle in. Shit gets real. But maybe --- just maybe --- you’ll come 
out the other side a little more dangerous in all the right ways.
