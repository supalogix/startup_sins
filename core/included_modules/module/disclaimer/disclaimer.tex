  This document is \textbf{NOT} peer-reviewed, NSF-funded, or even particularly well-written.  It is, however, written with the sincere hope that you’ll learn something \textit{without} wanting to gouge your eyes out from boredom.

  \medskip
  
  Let’s be clear. I’ve done my best to be technically accurate, but I make \textbf{no guarantees} about correctness, completeness, or usefulness.  This is \textbf{edutainment}: the mythical middle ground where education and amusement try to coexist without immediately strangling each other.

  \medskip
  
  \textbf{\large If you're one of the following, turn back now:}

  \medskip
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A pure academic who enjoys reading 500-page textbooks filled with Greek letters and no jokes.
    \item Someone high on the autism spectrum who craves strict formalism and zero ambiguity.
    \item A \textbf{consultant} peddling ``AI-powered disruption-as-a-service'' 
  \end{itemize}

  \medskip
  
  This is for normal, curious humans: engineers, analysts, and execs with a hunch that most “AI” products are just fancy spreadsheets in trench coats.

  \medskip
  
  If I can stop even one boardroom from buying a seven-figure machine learning dashboard that just runs linear regression in Comic Sans, I’ll consider this a massive win.

  \medskip
  
  So relax. Laugh. Learn. And, rage against the buzzword machine.
