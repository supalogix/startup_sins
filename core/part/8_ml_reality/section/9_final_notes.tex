\subsection{Final Note: These Are Not Just Technical Problems — They’re Human Ones}

By now, you’ve seen the horror stories. Broken pipelines, ghost models, angry VPs, and 3AM deploys that end in Slack meltdowns. But here’s the thing:

\textbf{None of these are really about technology. They’re about people.}

There’s a fundamental law of software systems called \textbf{Conway’s Law}. It states:

\begin{quote}
\textit{“Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.”}
\end{quote}

In other words, your tech stack \textit{will reflect} how your teams talk (or don’t talk) to each other. You can build the cleanest architecture in the world, but if your teams are siloed, feuding, or full of invisible incentives — that structure will show up in your code, your infra, and your incident logs.

You don’t get to opt out of Conway’s Law.\\
You only get to decide whether it happens consciously or unconsciously.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent\textbf{Here’s a real example.}

I once worked at a company where we were the first team to do anything with machine learning. It was an exciting opportunity — until I realized I had two of everything:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Two email addresses
    \item Two VPN clients
    \item Two Single Sign-On credentials
    \item Two data warehouses
\end{itemize}

It was a logistical nightmare.

If I wanted to run a training job, I had to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Log into VPN A
    \item Pull data from Data Warehouse A
    \item Save it to my local machine
    \item Disconnect
    \item Log into VPN B
    \item Push that data into Data Warehouse B
    \item Run training scripts using Warehouse B’s compute environment
\end{enumerate}

It was absurd. No one could explain why the system was built this way.

Eventually, we found out.

There were two VPs who couldn’t stand each other.\\
Each one built their own siloed stack — email, auth, infra, data — just to avoid dealing with the other’s team. The division was so bad that the company \textit{almost sued itself} during a turf war over quarterly numbers.

And here’s the kicker:

\textbf{No amount of Kubernetes or MLOps or PyTorch magic will fix that.}

The human problems will always keep leaking chaos into your system.

\subsection{Why Don’t Managers Understand It’s a People Problem?}

You’d think this would be obvious. Managers are supposed to manage people. And yet, when faced with disaster after disaster in large-scale tech projects, the post-mortems never say “turns out our incentive structures were trash” or “Susan and Alex have been in a passive-aggressive feud since Q2.” No, they blame the \textit{technology}.

Why? One phrase: \textbf{Scientific Management}.

The legacy of Frederick Winslow Taylor — the guy who once timed workers with a stopwatch and thought humans could be optimized like conveyor belts — still haunts us. In that worldview, technology is a resource. People are just slightly more unpredictable resources. You don’t lead them; you allocate them.

This mindset infects every layer of enterprise thinking. You need to ship an ML pipeline? Great — break it down into epics, assign tickets, apply Agile rituals like some kind of corporate rain dance, and then yell “why aren’t we in production yet” after week three.

But here’s the real problem: building a robust, scalable, enterprise-level ML system is not like laying bricks or assembling IKEA furniture. It’s like trying to build a goddamn \textbf{Ringworld} — a megastructure so large it orbits a star.

And your engineers? They are not obedient little factory workers. Managers love to pretend their teams are Pak: unemotional, logical, efficient. The reality is: they’re \textit{humans}. Messy, emotional, status-conscious humans.

Humans are hyper-intelligent, ruthless, single-minded entities who can accomplish miraculous things when aligned… but also prone to war, sabotage, and blowing everything up if they feel like it.

If humans were tasked with building the Ringworld, here’s what would actually happen:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A third of the project would die in committee trying to name the initiative.
    \item Another third would be duplicated because “someone on the other team already started that module but didn’t tell anyone.”
    \item Two rival PMs would get into a flame war over metric vs. imperial units, and the final product would explode because someone used inches instead of centimeters (again).
    \item Half the engineers would be on burnout leave.
    \item The other half would be doomscrolling in Slack threads labeled \texttt{ringworld-gov-structure-drama}.
    \item Legal would step in to redact the propulsion specs because of some lawsuit with a former intern who “accidentally discovered cold fusion.”
\end{itemize}

And even if — by some miracle — the tech worked, the people problems would still implode the whole thing from the inside out. Conway’s Law doesn’t care about your deadlines. It doesn’t care about your clean abstractions or your fancy YAML configs. It simply says:  
\textbf{Your system will look exactly like the worst parts of your org chart.}

So no, the Ringworld won’t fail because of gravitational shear or insufficient materials.

It’ll fail because Todd from procurement got into a slap-fight with your lead ML engineer over Jira access, and now no one can order the tungsten for the structural frame.

Before you design your next ML pipeline, ask not just “what framework should we use?”\\
Ask “who needs to talk to whom — and what’s getting in the way?”

That’s where real reliability begins.
