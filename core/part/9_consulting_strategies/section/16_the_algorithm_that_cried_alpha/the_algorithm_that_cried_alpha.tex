\section{The Algorithm That Cried Alpha: Forecasting Everything Except Reality}


\begin{quote}
Build a model that sort-of works, rename it something Greek, and pray no one asks what a hyperparameter is.
\end{quote}


  In the world of overpromised forecasts, \textbf{attention is currency}.
  
  \medskip
  
  A mediocre model wrapped in a Greek letter—\textit{AlphaPredict\texttrademark}, anyone?—isn’t about accuracy. It’s about making sure executives remember the name.
  
  \medskip
  
  \textbf{Law 6} from \textit{The 48 Laws of Power} explains this perfectly:
  \begin{quote}
  Court attention at all costs. The more mysterious and complex you appear, the more people assume value.
  \end{quote}
  
  \medskip
  
  That’s why these models rarely come with source code or error bounds—\textit{mystique} sells better than math.
  
  \medskip
  
  If the pitch focuses more on branding than backtesting, you're not being offered a solution—you’re being dazzled into forgetting to ask if it works.
  
  


\ExecutiveChecklist{high}{Spotting Overpromised Forecasts}{
  \item Ask: “What happened the last time this model made a prediction?”
  \item Require real-world backtesting results with timeframes and baselines.
  \item Demand error bounds—not just the mean.
  \item Reject anything with Greek names and no source code.

  title={Psychological Sidebar: Mental Sets — When Your Brain Forgets to Ask if There's a Better Way}]

In 1942, psychologist \textbf{Abraham Luchins} demonstrated a strange flaw in human thinking:  
Once people learn a method to solve a problem, they will keep using it—even when faster, easier solutions are obvious.

\medskip

In his classic experiment, participants were asked to measure water using jars of different sizes.  
After being trained to solve problems using a complex multi-step method, they stubbornly continued using it—\textit{even when a one-step solution was right in front of them}.

\medskip

This cognitive trap is called a \textbf{mental set}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We default to the familiar, even when it no longer works.
    \item We mistake method for merit, complexity for competence.
    \item We stop questioning whether the old approach even fits the new problem.
\end{itemize}

\medskip

In the world of overhyped algorithms and "AlphaPredict™" forecasts, mental sets take a corporate form:  
Once a model is branded, presented, and remembered, executives trust it—not because it works, but because questioning it would require admitting that the original investment might have been a mistake.

\medskip

\begin{quote}
\textbf{The hidden danger:} Once your brain accepts the first complicated solution, it stops looking for a simpler, better one.
\end{quote}

\medskip

\textbf{The Lesson?} Never confuse familiarity with accuracy. If no one’s asking whether the model still fits the data, you’re not forecasting—you’re reciting.

  title={Historical Sidebar: Enron’s “Greek Letter” Accounting — When Complexity Masked Collapse}]

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, \textbf{Enron} was hailed as one of America's most innovative companies, celebrated for pioneering new energy markets and "reinventing" finance.  
Behind the buzzwords, though, Enron’s real innovation was in manufacturing opacity.

\medskip

The company built complex financial structures called \textbf{Special Purpose Entities (SPEs)} to hide debt off its balance sheet.  
It used \textbf{mark-to-market accounting} to record hypothetical future profits as current earnings—no matter how unrealistic those projections were.

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
    \item Financial models dazzled investors with technical jargon and endless growth curves.
    \item Real-world fundamentals—like actual cash flow and solvency—became afterthoughts.
    \item Internal critics who questioned the math were marginalized or ignored.
\end{itemize}

\medskip

The complexity wasn’t accidental—it was a feature, not a bug.  
By wrapping simple debt-hiding schemes in dense, technical language, Enron kept analysts, regulators, and investors spinning in the illusion of unstoppable success.

\medskip

\begin{quote}
\textbf{The implied strategy:} If your model is complicated enough, no one will notice that it predicts magic.
\end{quote}

\medskip

When reality finally caught up, Enron collapsed in spectacular fashion—erasing \$74 billion in shareholder value and annihilating Arthur Andersen, one of the largest accounting firms in the world.

\medskip

\textbf{The Lesson?} Mystique can buy you time, but not solvency. When complexity outpaces reality, the crash isn’t a matter of if—it’s a matter of when.
