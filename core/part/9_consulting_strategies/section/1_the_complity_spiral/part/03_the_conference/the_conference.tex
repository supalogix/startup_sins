\Large
The best cons aren’t hidden.\\
They’re handed to you like a gift.\\
They are sealed with charm.\\
And they are signed in your own handwriting.\\
\ \\
They don’t steal your will.\\
They offer it back to you.\\
And they leave the illusion of authorship intact.\\
\ \\
Because the most elegant manipulations...\\ 
are the ones you willing participate in.\\
\ \\
And the most dangerous lies...\\
are the ones you tell yourself.\\
