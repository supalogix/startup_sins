    The best cons aren’t hidden. They dazzle and shine. \\
    They're wrapped like a present and labeled as ``mine.'' \\
    They’re sealed with a smile, with elegance cast, \\
    And signed by your hand -- tethered and fast. \\
    \ \\
    They don’t break your will or bend it by force. \\
    They hand it back gently and let you steer course. \\
    They whisper, ``You chose this,'' then quietly grin, \\
    As you trace the path they drew from within. \\
    \ \\
    For the finest deceits don’t need to intrude.\\
    They flourish when dressed as your own attitude. \\
    You play every part. You sing every verse, \\
    Not knowing the script only makes it worse. \\
    \ \\
    And the most dangerous lie is soft and not loud.\\
    The kind that you whisper and wear like a shroud. \\
    It lives in the mirror. It calls itself true. \\
    And it thrives when the one who believes it... is you. \\
