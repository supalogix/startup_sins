You can’t automate love. It won’t run on command. \\ 
It slips through the code like a fistful of sand. \\
No script can replace what a heartbeat can do. \\
There's no proxy for presence --- not even a few. \\
\ \\
You can’t outsource warmth or a look in the eyes. \\
Or silence that speaks without needing disguise. \\
You can’t ship a hug or a whisper at night.\\
Or mimic the pause between wrongness and right. \\
\ \\
And a locked room, no matter how sound the excuse, \\
Still echoes with absence, and still tightens the noose. \\
It teaches that distance is safer than touch, \\
That love --- when it's fragile --- just asks you too much. \\
\ \\
So be there. Be messy. Let moments unfold.\\
What matters won't scale. It can’t be controlled.
