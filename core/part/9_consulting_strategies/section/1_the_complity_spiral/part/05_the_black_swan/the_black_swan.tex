    You were not framed.\\
    You were quietly named.\\
    Because breaking you cost them less than their shame.\\
    \ \\
    They didnâ€™t deceive you.\\
    They carved out the facts.\\
    Then handed them back \\
    With omissions intact.\\
    \ \\
    They needed a symbol.\\
    And you needed peace.\\
    So you bowed from a game\\
    That grants no release.\\
