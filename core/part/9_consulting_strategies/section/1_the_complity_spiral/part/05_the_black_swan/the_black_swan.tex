    \Large
    You weren’t framed.\\
    You were selected.\\
    Because your fall was easier than theirs.\\
    \ \\
    They didn’t lie.\\
    They told you the truth...\\
    in just the right shape...\\
    to make you kneel.\\
    \ \\
    It wasn’t justice.\\
    It was choreography.\\
    Because survival requires a script.\\
    \ \\
    You didn’t lose.\\
    You refused to win.\\
    Because the cost to win...\\
    was becoming one of them.\\
