\subsection{The Setup}

It was a few hours later.

The coffee had gone stale. The folder still sat on the table, unopened, but no longer untouched. 
Kessler had tapped it once, maybe twice. That was all.

Hart stood by the window, watching the city fold into late afternoon—gold slicing across the 
skyline like it didn’t know what had happened.

There was a knock.

Kessler didn’t answer. Hart did.

“Come in.”

Penn stepped through. No tie. Slate-gray suit. Slim black notebook in one hand, nothing in the 
other. He moved with the relaxed precision of someone who didn’t waste motion because he never 
needed to rush.

Hart turned. “Kessler, this is Penn.”

Kessler nodded. “You’re the one who wrote the original Joint Venture terms.”

“Correct,” Penn said. “Which means I understand the skeleton beneath the narrative. And how to 
dismantle it without triggering a seizure.”

He sat, flipped open his notebook, and laid it flat on the table between them. 
Neat columns. Numbered scenarios. Small arrows connecting roles, not names.

“This is about control,” Penn said calmly. “Not of what happened, but of what people think happened.”

Kessler leaned in, scanning the page.

Hart stayed quiet.

“The risk,” Penn continued, “is regulatory escalation. SEC, sure. But worse are optics: 
contagion across funds, spillover into investor confidence, reputational bleed. We need a pressure valve.”

“David,” Kessler said.

Penn nodded. “He’s the one who signed off on the shipping spread. He presented the model. 
He greenlit exposure three weeks before détente. That’s narrative alignment.”

“Not criminal,” Hart said. “Just... human error.”

“Extreme negligence,” Penn clarified. “Palatable. Clean. And more importantly—believable.”

He turned to the next page. The trust structure.

\textbf{HoldCo-Delta Holdings LLC}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Settlement Agreement}
    \item \textit{Irrevocable Grantor Trust}
    \item Tuition, mortgage, medical disbursement
    \item \textit{No press, no litigation, no appeal}
\end{itemize}

Penn slid a separate page toward Kessler. “If he signs, he gets this. Quiet continuity. 
The kids are provided for. Emma doesn't have to go to work. His name disappears from public 
filings in twelve months.”

Kessler didn’t move.

Penn closed the book.

“He won’t fight it,” he said. “Because fighting means freezing the accounts, forfeiting the trust, 
and not providing for his family. He won’t choose ego over insulation.”

Hart added, “He’s a father.”

Kessler exhaled sympatheticly through his nose. “And a good one.”

“That’s why it works,” Penn said.

No one moved for a long moment.

Then Kessler tapped the folder again—once.

“Bring him in,” he said.

\begin{PsychologicalSidebar}{Why Friends Still Throw Friends Under the Bus}

    In behavioral psychology, there's a dangerous cognitive gap between \textbf{being cruel}
    and \textbf{acting in a system that demands cruelty}.
    
    \medskip
    
    The men in this room are not psychopaths.  
    They have families. They tip well. They remember birthdays.

    \medskip
    
    But under pressure, they participate in behavior that—on paper—looks sociopathic.
    
    \medskip
    
    This is a known phenomenon.

    \medskip
    
    
    \textbf{Albert Bandura}, in his work on \textit{moral disengagement}, showed how ordinary 
    people commit unethical acts by reframing them as neutral, necessary, or even virtuous:

    \medskip
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item “It’s not personal.”
        \item “We’re protecting the firm.”
        \item “This is the best option for everyone.”
    \end{itemize}
    
    \medskip
    
    They’re not throwing David under the bus because they enjoy it.  
    They’re doing it because \textbf{the system rewarded them for solving problems cleanly}, 
    and \textbf{he became the cleanest lever}.
    
    \medskip
    
    There’s an old saying:
    \begin{quote}
        \textit{Throw a piece of meat in front of two starving dogs and they’ll fight --- \\
        even if they’ve always shared the bowl.}
    \end{quote}
    
    \medskip
    
    This isn’t about sadism.  
    It’s about proximity to collapse.  
    \textbf{Survival ethics distort judgment.} 
    Especially in institutions.
    
    \medskip
    
    Under crisis conditions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Loyalty becomes liability.
        \item Empathy becomes inefficiency.
        \item And responsibility becomes something you offload before it sticks.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \medskip
    
    They aren’t monsters.

    \medskip
    
    They’re just very good at pretending they have no choice.
