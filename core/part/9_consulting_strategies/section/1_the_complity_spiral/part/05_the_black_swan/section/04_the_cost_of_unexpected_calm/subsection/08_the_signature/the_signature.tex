\subsection{The Signature}

David opened the folder. Read the statement again, though he already knew every word.

\textit{After deep reflection and in light of recent volatility, I’ve decided to resign from my 
position at Arcadia Capital. The events of the past weeks reflect areas where our internal models 
failed to anticipate scenario variance and sector interdependencies. That failure, under my 
oversight, had consequences. I take responsibility for those outcomes. I believe the firm will 
recover and evolve. This is the right time for me to step away.}

It wasn’t quite an apology.

But it was enough.

He turned the page. There it was:
Resignation and Indemnification Waiver — pre-filled. One signature line. One date field.

David picked up the pen.

Clicked it once.

Paused.

His thumb hovered over the ink tip like it might still offer him a choice.

It didn’t.

He signed.

Then dated it.

And that was that.

No ceremony. No handshake. No press statement.

Just a folder, now heavier than before.

Penn sat opposite with the tablet closed and his hands folded. 
His expression was neutral which is the legal equivalent of sympathy.

Penn stood. Took the document.

``We’ll handle the rest.''

David didn’t respond.

Hart stepped forward as Penn left.

``You did the right thing.''

David looked up at him.

``No,'' he said. ``I did the only thing.''

Hart didn’t argue. He just nodded.

Then he left too.

David sat alone in the room for another minute.

Then two.

Then he clicked the pen closed, set it on the table, and walked out.

\begin{HistoricalSidebar}{\textbf{The Peace of Surrender: Solzhenitsyn and the Psychology of Resignation}}

    In \textit{The Gulag Archipelago}, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn recounts a haunting anecdote:  

    \medskip
    
    A priest — long hunted by the KGB — was hidden for years by sympathetic villagers. He lived 
    not in freedom, but in fear.  
    Each knock at the door. Each rumor. Each footstep in the snow could be his end.  

    \medskip
    
    When the KGB finally found him, they expected terror.  
    Instead, the priest smiled.

    \medskip
    
    \textit{“This is the happiest day of my life,”} he said.

    \medskip
    
    Not because he wanted prison.  
    But because the waiting was over.  
    Because he no longer had to \textit{calculate} survival.  

    \medskip
    
    Solzhenitsyn writes that the human soul can endure almost anything — except prolonged ambiguity.  
    That’s why, in the gulags, many walked calmly to their fate.  
    Why, in Nazi camps, some stood quietly in line for execution.

    \medskip
    
    Because once choice becomes illusion, peace can come not from escape but from surrender.
    
    \medskip
    
    \textbf{In David’s world, the machinery is cleaner. More polite.}  
    No gulag. No camp.  
    Just a boardroom, a pen, and a signature that rewrites history in the voice of corporate 
    self-correction.

    \medskip
    
    But the feeling is the same.

    \medskip
    
    That moment when the ambiguity ends.  
    When the performance ends.  
    When the war inside becomes still.

    \medskip
    
    And when, for the first time in months —  
    you can breathe without calculating the next contingency.
