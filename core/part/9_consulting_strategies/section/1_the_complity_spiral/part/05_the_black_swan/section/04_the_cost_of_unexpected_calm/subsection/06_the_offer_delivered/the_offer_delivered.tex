\subsection{The Offer, Delivered}

The conference room was quiet except for the sound of the television in the corner — muted, but with 
subtitles still running:

“Arcadia Capital faces liquidity crisis amid exposure mispricing. SEC monitoring developments.”

David watched the screen, jaw set. Behind the anchor, B-roll of the Arcadia building played in 
slow, looping shame.

Kessler poured coffee. Hart didn’t touch his.

They weren’t seated at the table like equals. David was sitting. They were standing.

It wasn’t an accident.

Kessler spoke first. Calm. Practiced.

“We’re not going to sugarcoat this.”

David didn’t respond.

Hart stepped in. “The narrative is moving fast. We don’t control it. The board doesn’t 
control it. But we can contain it.”

David looked at them both. “Who’s getting thrown?”

Kessler didn’t flinch. “You already know.”

David nodded once. Quiet. “And you’re just here to make it sound noble.”

Hart gave a small sigh. “David, this isn’t about you. It’s about survival. The firm’s. 
The board’s. Even Yours.”

David scoffed. “You think I survive this?”

Hart leaned forward. “If you don’t fight it... yes.”

Kessler slid a folder across the table. This time, David opened it.

Legal prep. Talking points. Internal memos—revised. A resignation statement, drafted but undated.

David didn’t touch the pen.

Hart continued. “We’re not accusing you of fraud. That wouldn’t hold. And it wouldn’t be clean.”

Kessler added, “But extreme negligence? That has legs. The lawyers can thread it through the 
shipping exposure. Sector assumptions. Model oversight.”

“Something that sounds like a mistake,” Hart said. “Not a crime.”

David stared at the paper. “So that’s the pitch? I’m not corrupt. I'm just stupid?”

“It’s more believable,” Kessler said, tone flat. “And easier to forgive.”

Hart added, “We’ve set up a structure. Quiet trusts. Deferred comp unlocked. School covered. 
House refinanced. Medical locked in. Everything your family needs.”

David didn’t speak.

Hart kept going. “We’ll handle the PR. You step down quietly. Take responsibility for ‘risk 
oversight failures.’ And in exchange, we make sure your name fades quietly — not loudly. 
And your family? Provided for.”

Kessler leaned in now, not unkind. Just final.

“You take care of us,” he said, “and we take care of them.”

David’s eyes never left the statement in front of him.

Then he looked up, and for a moment there was fire in the way he held Hart’s gaze.

“You always knew it would come to this,” he said.

Michael simply said ``I hoped it wouldn't''.

Kessler added, ``It’s not personal.''

David smiled. Just a little.

``No,'' he said. ``It’s just business.''

\begin{TechnicalSidebar}{\textbf{Game Theory at the Endgame --- The Nash Equilibrium of Corporate Fallout}}

    In game theory, a \textbf{Nash Equilibrium} occurs when no player has anything to gain by changing 
    only their own strategy (assuming the other players stick to theirs).

    \medskip
    
    It’s not necessarily optimal.  
    It’s not necessarily fair.  
    But it’s stable.
    
    \medskip
    
    \textbf{This scene is a textbook Nash setup:}

    \medskip
    
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{The Board} needs a scapegoat to protect the firm and calm regulators.
      \item \textbf{David} wants to protect his family and avoid litigation.
      \item \textbf{Hart and Kessler} need a clean exit narrative that is plausible, contained, 
      and non-criminal.
    \end{itemize}

    \medskip
    
    None of them love this solution.  
    But none of them have a better unilateral option.
    
    \medskip
    
    \textbf{If David resists?}  
    The board might go public, imply fraud, freeze payouts, and spark a deeper investigation.  
    Everyone loses.
    
    \textbf{If the board pushes harder?}  
    David might talk. To the press. Or regulators. Or both.  
    Everyone loses.
    
    \medskip
    
    So they converge on the least-worst strategy... not because it’s noble, but because it’s survivable.
    
    \medskip
    
    \textbf{In payoff terms:}

    \medskip
    
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textit{Board gets stability}
      \item \textit{David gets silence-for-security}
      \item \textit{Public gets a tidy narrative}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \medskip
    
    It’s not a win.

    \medskip
    
    It’s a \textbf{corporate equilibrium}. It's  
    where everyone walks away slightly wounded,  
    but no one bleeds out in public.
    
    \medskip
    
    \textbf{As Nash himself once said:}  
    \textit{“The best for the group comes when everyone in the group does what’s best for 
    himself and the group.”}
    
    \medskip
    
    In this room,  
    that wasn’t idealism.  
    It was policy.
