    Rock bottom won’t always come dressed as despair.\\
    It sometimes shows up in the soft morning air.\\
    It smells like regret that pains you so strong.\\
    Then whispers to you, ``You’ve drifted too long.''\\
    \ \\
    Redemption comes slowly. It won’t make a scene.\\
    It shows up in moments you hadn’t foreseen.\\
    In holding her tightly. In brushing their hair.\\
    In toys left behind and the silence they share.\\
    \ \\
    By the time the truth cuts through all the noise,\\
    You’re not chasing glory. You’re grasping for poise.\\
    You're praying the people you've pushed far away\\
    Still leave out a chair at the end of the day.\\
