\part{The Aftermath}

    Rock bottom doesn’t always feel like the end.\\
    Sometimes it feels like pancakes on a Tuesday.\\
    Sometimes it sounds like children laughing.\\
    And sometimes it smells like dryer sheets and lost time.\\
    \ \\
    Not all prisons have bars.\\
    Some have inboxes.\\
    Some have ambition.\\
    And some are built from the promises we forgot to keep.\\
    \ \\
    Because redemption doesn’t come loud.\\
    It comes barefoot.\\
    It comes dish by dish.\\
    And it comes one forgotten glance at a time.\\
    \ \\
    And by the time you realize what mattered most,\\
    you are no longer building an empire.\\
    You are just hoping those you love still want you at the table.\\
