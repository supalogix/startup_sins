\subsection{The Validator}

``Who approved the leverage?'' asked the Senior Forensic Analyst from the SEC, eyes steady 
over rimless glasses.

David sat with his hands folded, palms damp. ``The decision to raise the exposure cap came 
from the portfolio team.  I wasn’t involved in that approval.''

\medskip

\begin{TechnicalSidebar}{What Is an Exposure Cap?}

  An \textbf{exposure cap} is a formal limit on the amount of financial risk that a fund, portfolio, or 
  institution is allowed to take in a specific asset class, counterparty, product type, or strategy.

  \medskip
  
  \textbf{Purpose:}

  \medskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item To prevent over-concentration in volatile or illiquid assets.
    \item To contain downside risk during periods of stress or mispricing.
    \item To ensure regulatory or internal compliance thresholds are respected.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \medskip

  \textbf{Types of Exposure Caps:}

  \medskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Gross Exposure Cap:} Limits total value of positions, regardless of hedges.
    \item \textit{Net Exposure Cap:} Accounts for long vs. short positions; emphasizes directional risk.
    \item \textit{Risk-Weighted Cap:} Adjusts exposure limits based on volatility, VaR, or margin 
    requirements.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \medskip

  \textbf{Governance:}

  \medskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Usually set by Investment Committees or Risk Committees.
    \item Changes require formal documentation and often legal or compliance sign-off.
    \item Breaches can trigger mandatory de-risking, trading halts, or escalated reviews.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \medskip

  \textbf{Why It Matters:}  
  
  \medskip

  A raised exposure cap may unlock additional profit potential — but it also \textit{amplifies systemic 
  vulnerability}, especially if liquidity assumptions or model dependencies are flawed. When paired with 
  synthetic instruments or leveraged products, the risk scales non-linearly.

The analyst didn’t nod. He just blinked once. ``But you provided the risk assessment, correct?''

David hesitated. ``I prepared the system output. Yes.''

``Specifically the version dated three days before the exposure increase?''

``Yes.''

The analyst flipped through a binder, stopping at a page with highlighted sections. ``According 
to this, the model 
flagged an increase in cross-asset volatility. Why was that column excluded in the final risk 
memo sent to Investment Oversight?''

David felt the heat rise in his neck. ``We were still calibrating the signal. At that point, 
it had high sensitivity and was generating noise—false positives.''

``And who made the decision to suppress it?''

David paused. ``Technically, I did.''

``Why?''

He swallowed. ``Because I didn’t want it to distract from the broader findings. The rest of the 
model showed acceptable thresholds.''

The analyst looked up. ``Acceptable under what assumptions?''

``Under calm regime behavior. Which, at the time—''

``—was already breaking down in commodity markets,'' the analyst interrupted gently. ``You removed 
the only indicator showing early instability. Why?''

David shifted in his seat. ``We thought it was a blip. Noise.''

``Did you note that in the report?''

``No. It didn’t seem material at the time.''

``Yet it was material enough to suppress?''

The room fell quiet.

The analyst tapped his pen once on the table. ``So, when Investment Oversight pushed the leverage 
increase, they were acting under the impression that all volatility indicators were neutral.''

David didn’t answer.

``And the one flag that wasn’t neutral — the one warning sign — was missing because you thought 
it might cause confusion.''

David looked down. ``I didn’t mean to mislead anyone.''

``Intent isn't the question,'' the analyst said. ``The question is whether your report enabled 
a decision that should never have been made.''

Another pause. Then:

``Mr. Morales,'' he continued, ``your name appears on the approval workflow. Not as decision-maker, 
but as validator. Your initials are here—right under the model output. Do you dispute that?''

David stared at the page.

``No,'' he said quietly. ``I don’t dispute that.''

``Thank you,'' the analyst said, and closed the binder with a soft click.

``That will do for now.''

\begin{HistoricalSidebar}{The SEC and the Theater of Responsibility}

  Founded in the wake of the 1929 crash, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was designed as both 
  watchdog and confessor. It was designed to be part enforcement arm, and part national conscience for financial markets.

  \medskip
  
  Its mandate is simple: protect investors, ensure fair markets, and hold those accountable who threaten either. 
  But the execution is rarely so clean.

  \medskip
  
  In scenarios like David’s, the SEC doesn't storm the gates with sirens. It arrives in tailored suits and 
  calibrated language, interested less in guilt than in \textit{who signed what, and when}. It reconstructs the internal 
  machinery: approval chains, suppressed signals, reporting thresholds — all to trace how a decision came to look inevitable.

  \medskip
  
  By the time the SEC enters the room, the damage is already done. Its job is to illuminate the moment it became 
  irreversible, to identify who, and hold the flashlight on them.
