\section{The Complicity Spiral: How to Make Everyone Dirty So No One Can Cleanly Leave}

\subsection{Horror Trope: Fake Relationship}

This story is similar to the Steven King's Carrie. There is something about the 
relationship that is not genuine. The power trope comes from knowing who has the
knowledge, what is the purpose of the lie, and how it will be revealed.


\subsubsection{Trope Synposis}

For some of us, starting our own business is hell; unfortunately, that is true for
David Morales, too. Business (\textbf{politics, workplace}) is one big, \textbf{forced proximity}
trope for David (\textbf{loner, tortured hero}) only gets more suffocating. David''s
shy and naive nature (\textbf{fish out of water}) makes him an easy target for 
Micheal and Serena (\textbf{antagonist, stalker}) when David get's his first big break.
Micheal and Serena (\textbf{suspects}) tormet his bewilerment (\textbf{victim}). 
David''s wife Emma (\textbf{protector}) tries to help David but inadvertently makes 
things worse.

Later, Emma''s desire to help her husband (\textbf{loner, fish out of water}) makes
her and easy target for Micheal and Serena (\textbf{antagonist, stalker}). Emma is 
at first suspicious of their help as she is a bit naive about the lifestyle 
(\textbf{secrets}).

Upon attending social gatherings, her \textbf{fake relationship} blossoms under 
Micheal and Serena's attention (\textbf{fish out of water}) and enjoys herself
(\textbf{red herring}). The ever present Serena (\textbf{mentor}) reassures Emma
about the world she wants to enter and new experiences she could enjoy.

After her first sexual encounter, she fully embrases her new identity 
(\textbf{fairy tale, ugly duckling}).

However, Micheal and Serena (\textbf{hidden identity})
are using her to manipulate David
(\textbf{the con}). When David (\textbf{man in peril}) get''s blamed for the
engineering failure (\textbf{stranded}), Micheal throws David under the bus
(\textbf{tortured hero, victim}).

In the aftermath, David has to deal with auditors and regulators (\textbf{road trip}).
He doesn't understand, that Micheal has rigged the situation (\textbf{the con}).
With David (\textbf{man in peril}) being the face of the system failure, everyone
involved (\textbf{red herring}) is incentivized to play along (\textbf{mistaken identity}).

In the end, Serena is with David but is no longer wants to be with him (\textbf{forced 
proximity}).
Micheal and Emma (\textbf{stalker}) have drawn Emma into their circle of influence 
(\textbf{victim}).

The extra fuel of the \textbf{fake relationship} is David's feeling of betrayal by Emma.




\subsection{Emotion Amplifiers}

\subsubsection{David Morales (Indecision)}

\paragraph{Description} David is modeled after Rick from Casablanca. Casablanca is a love story
with an opening world of luxury that constantly jabs at Rick's weakness. His fabulous bar, 
the Cafe Americain, reminds him at every turn of the love he lost in romantic Paris. The club
is also all about making money, which Rick can do only if he pays off a traitorous French 
police captain. Every magnificent corner of his bar shows Rick how far he has fallen into 
a self-centered cynicism while the luxurious world around him is slowely revealed to be 
a world of pain, suffering, and slavery.

David similarly lives in a world of luxury. However, the world around him is not as it seems,
and through the story we learn of the uglyness of his world. The difference between David
and Rick is that David is desperately trying to save the love he has, but ultimately destroys 
it in his attempt to save it.

this hellhole, relentlessly presses in on her until she breaks.

Emma is also a self-deceptive womeon who seeks romance and pretty things and eventually
