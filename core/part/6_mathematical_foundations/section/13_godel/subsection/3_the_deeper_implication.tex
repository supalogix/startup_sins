\subsection{The Deeper Implication: Truth and Proof Are Not the Same}

Before Gödel, many believed that truth and provability were the same thing. If a statement was true, then surely a clever enough person (or machine) could prove it, given enough time.

Gödel shattered that illusion.

There are true mathematical statements that we will never prove — not because we’re not clever enough, but because the system itself simply can’t reach them.

\textbf{So what died with Gödel’s theorem?} Not mathematics. But certainty. The hope for a perfect, airtight foundation collapsed.
