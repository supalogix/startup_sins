\section{Bernoulli and the Law of Large Numbers: Predicting Uncertainty}

\subsection{From Individual Chance to Collective Certainty}

While Pascal and Fermat laid the foundations of probability theory, it was Jakob Bernoulli who realized a deeper truth: even when individual events are governed by chance, collective patterns emerge with remarkable regularity.

In his posthumously published work, \textit{Ars Conjectandi} (1713), Bernoulli introduced the \textbf{Law of Large Numbers} — a profound insight into the nature of probability and predictability.

\subsection{The Key Idea}

Bernoulli's Law of Large Numbers states:

\begin{quote}
    As the number of independent repetitions of a random experiment increases, the proportion of outcomes of a particular type will, with high probability, converge to a fixed value — the true probability of that outcome.
\end{quote}

In other words: while any single trial is uncertain, the average behavior over many trials becomes predictable.

\subsection{Formalizing Intuition}

Bernoulli provided a mathematical proof — primitive by modern standards but groundbreaking for its time — that, given enough repetitions, the observed frequency of success would almost certainly approximate the theoretical probability to any desired degree of accuracy.

Key features of his contribution:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Quantitative Bounds:} Bernoulli sought not just to claim convergence, but to estimate how many trials were needed to achieve a given confidence.
    \item \textbf{Foundations for Statistical Thinking:} He pioneered the idea that probability could govern reasoning about real-world data, long before formal statistics existed.
    \item \textbf{Bridging the Finite and the Infinite:} Bernoulli linked finite observations to long-run regularities, a conceptual leap critical to modern science.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{A New Vision of Order in Chance}

Bernoulli's Law of Large Numbers transformed probability from a theory of games and isolated bets into a theory of populations, experiments, and long-term behavior. It laid the groundwork for statistical mechanics, actuarial science, and the emergence of statistics as a formal discipline.

Where Pascal and Fermat taught us to calculate the odds of a single event, Bernoulli taught us to see \textit{order in the aggregate} — the first glimpse of the powerful idea that randomness itself has a structure.
