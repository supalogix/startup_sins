\section{Barrow: Geometric Proportions and Tangents (1670)}

Isaac Barrow, the teacher of Newton, described what we now call calculus entirely through **geometric constructions**. He avoided algebra and worked with labeled curves and figures.

Let a curve \( AB \) be drawn, with perpendiculars (ordinates) erected from a baseline. Let another curve \( AP \) be constructed such that:

\begin{quote}
\textit{“The ordinate of \( AP \) at any point is proportional to the sum of the ordinates of the curve \( AB \) up to that point.”}
\end{quote}

Then, Barrow would assert:

\begin{quote}
\textit{“The tangent to the curve \( AP \) at a point is proportional to the height of the corresponding ordinate of the original curve \( AB \).”}
\end{quote}

Barrow’s geometric proof of this property was entirely visual, using proportions between small triangles drawn tangent to the area-accumulating curve and the original curve.

No functions, no coordinates—just proportions, ratios, and curves drawn carefully on a diagrammatic plane.
