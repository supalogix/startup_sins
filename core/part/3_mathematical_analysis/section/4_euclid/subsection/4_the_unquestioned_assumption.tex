\subsection{The Unquestioned Assumption: Space is Smooth}

Euclid never stopped to question whether space was actually made of infinitely divisible points, because to him, it had to be. If a line were made up of individual points stitched together, how would motion work? How would a shape exist? How would anything be continuous?

So, instead of proving continuity, Euclid did something far more powerful: he assumed it.

This was the real brilliance of Euclidean geometry. It didn’t just describe shapes; it described space itself as something that was \textbf{always connected, always smooth, and always well-behaved}.

And for a long time, that assumption was good enough. Euclid’s framework could be used to build temples, map the stars, and guide architects in their grandest designs. If there were hidden problems lurking within this perfect mathematical space, no one had any reason to suspect them.

At least, not yet.
