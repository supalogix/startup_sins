\section{John Backus and the Compiler: Teaching Machines to Read}

After Grace Hopper gave us the linker and loader—separating code from raw addresses—the next problem became painfully obvious:
\textbf{programming itself was still brutal.}

In the early 1950s, coding a machine meant thinking like a machine:
binary numbers, memory addresses, opcode tables. Every slight change meant hours (or days) of manual rewiring at the software level.

Enter \textbf{John Backus}.

\subsection{The Problem: Assembly Language Bottleneck}

By the time Hopper had invented symbolic addresses, programmers had a new tool: \textbf{assembly language}—still low-level, but better than raw machine code.

However, it still had serious problems:

\begin{itemize} \item Every program was deeply hardware-specific. \item Writing even simple algorithms was tedious and error-prone. \item Software development couldn't scale to match the growing ambitions of early computing. \end{itemize}

What was missing was a way to program at a higher level—closer to human reasoning, not hardware configuration.

\subsection{Backus’s Insight: A Translator for Code}

While working at IBM, John Backus had a radical idea:

\begin{quote} \textit{``What if you could write programs in a mathematical notation—and have the machine itself translate that into assembly?''} \end{quote}

This wasn’t just a shortcut. It was a new paradigm.

Instead of telling the machine \textit{how} to do everything step-by-step, a programmer could describe \textit{what} they wanted—and trust another program to handle the gritty details.

That "other program" would become known as the \textbf{compiler}.

\subsection{The First Major Compiler: FORTRAN (1957)}

Backus led the IBM team that created the first widely successful high-level programming language: \textbf{FORTRAN} (short for "Formula Translation"). It allowed engineers and scientists to write mathematical formulas directly, using syntax much closer to traditional mathematics.

FORTRAN wasn't just a language—it was the first practical \textbf{compiled language}:

\begin{itemize} \item Programmers wrote source code in a human-readable format. \item The compiler translated it into optimized machine code. \item Programs became faster to write, easier to debug, and portable across different hardware. \end{itemize}

\begin{quote} Compilers didn’t just automate programming.
They \textbf{abstracted it}. \end{quote}

\subsection{Backus–Naur Form (BNF): Structuring Languages Themselves}

Backus didn’t stop at inventing the compiler.
Later, in collaboration with Peter Naur, he introduced the \textbf{Backus–Naur Form (BNF)}—a formal system for describing the grammar of programming languages.

BNF wasn’t about implementation—it was about defining what a language even was. It provided a rigorous, mathematical structure for syntax that could be used to build future compilers systematically.

Without BNF, the entire field of compiler design—and modern programming languages—would have been pure chaos.

\subsection{Conclusion: From Gears to Grammars}

John Backus transformed programming from a mechanical craft into a linguistic and mathematical discipline.

Because of Backus:

\begin{itemize} \item Programming languages became expressive and high-level. \item Compilers became the bridge between human logic and machine execution. \item Software engineering became scalable, modular, and portable. \end{itemize}

\begin{quote} Before Backus, programming was a machine-language monologue.
After Backus, it became a human-machine dialogue. \end{quote}
