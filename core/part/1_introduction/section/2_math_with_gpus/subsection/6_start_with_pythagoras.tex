\subsection{To Understand Machine Learning, Start with Pythagoras}

So here's the twist.

We just spent a solid chunk of time unraveling the strange and powerful machinery behind Lebesgue integration—how it broke away from rectangles, reshaped our notion of size, and quietly underpins the expectation values in every neural net you’ve ever trained.

But if you really want to understand how we ended up here, elbow-deep in measure theory while trying to optimize emoji classifiers—you have to zoom out. Way out.

Because this story doesn’t start with GPUs. It doesn’t start with calculus. It doesn’t even start with Newton or Leibniz.

It starts with rope. And fields. And goats.

It starts with the ancient idea that the world could be understood in terms of quantity and proportion.

And then -- because humans are humans -- it spirals into obsession, philosophical doom-spirals, heated debates over religious doctrine, mathematicians trying to crack the mind of God, and communism (the scary kind and the utopian kind).

Before math became abstract and existential, it was earthy. It was about food, land, and avoiding spear fights. And then along came the Greeks, who looked at a triangle and said: “I bet this means something about the soul.”

So yes—if you're here for machine learning, you’re in the right place.

But first, we need to talk about how math broke people's brains long before it ever broke your training pipeline.

\textit{Let’s go back to the beginning.}
