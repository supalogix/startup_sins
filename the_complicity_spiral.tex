  \section*{Foreword}
  
  \bigskip
  
  \textbf{To Whom It May Concern (especially corporate counsel):}
  
  The book you’re about to read is a complete work of fiction.
  
  Any resemblance to actual founders, VCs, consultants, PR flacks, compliance departments, or 
  ``visionary'' platform evangelists is purely coincidental, tragic, and --- frankly --- your own fault 
  for drawing connections where none officially exist.
  
  \textbf{Let me state clearly, for the record, and for the discovery process:}
  This book is officially an imaginary work 
  constructed from (but not limited to) hypothetical observations, apocryphal anecdotes, and several long evenings of 
  bourbon-fueled storytelling in airport lounges.
  \footnote{Portions of this sentence were later redacted in settlement.}

  If any reader, investor, or regulatory agency believes otherwise, I cordially invite you to prove 
  in a court of law that this ``entirely fictitious'' account is, in fact, non-fiction.

  
  If, by some odd twist of fate, you believe that I have violated a non-disclosure agreement, 
  trade secret covenant, or federal gag order, please please please sue me.

  Make your case. Show the world that what I wrote was so accurate --- and so uncomfortably true --- 
  that it could only have come from behind closed doors. That would be, quite honestly, the best press 
  I’ve ever gotten.

  \section*{This Is Fiction (Unless It Isn’t): About the Series}

  The book you're reading is part of a larger, ongoing experiment in narrative disclosure.  
  The series is called \textbf{\textit{Startup Sins: Terms and Conditions May Destroy You}}. And yes, 
  the name is a warning.
  
  Each volume offers a different lens into the power structures of modern tech culture. And not the 
  one shown onstage at launch events, but the one muttered over late-night Slack threads, negotiated in 
  hallway whispers, and buried in unread compliance docs.
  
  The stories in this series were not written to expose specific people or companies.  
  They were written to expose the kind of patterns you start to see when pitch decks outnumber 
  product roadmaps, and institutional power hides behind the velvet curtain of founder mythology.
  
  We live in an era where startup culture promises revolution but delivers consolidation.
  Where innovation is just rebranded infrastructure, and where power operates not through violence, 
  but through vocabulary.
  
  In this world:
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item ``Agility'' means no accountability.
    \item ``Vision'' means vibes with a vest.
    \item ``Transformation'' usually means someone in ops is about to get laid off while marketing posts about empathy.
  \end{itemize}
  
  The motivation for this series was simple:
  Too many people are too fluent in bullshit.
  Too many rooms are filled with brilliant minds saying nothing, wrapped in synergy decks, and 
  rewarded for their ability to confidently explain nothing in five different ways.
  
  Also, I'll be honest about the real spark behind this particular book:
  \textbf{HBO’s \textit{Silicon Valley}}.
  
  I hated that show.
  I did not hate it because it was bad.
  I hated it because it was \textit{too good}.  
  I hated it because it was \textit{too painfully good}. 
  
  I couldn’t get through more than two episodes without pausing to whisper, 
  \textit{``I was in that meeting.''}
  
  It wasn’t funny when it happened to me.
  It was traumatic.
  \textit{How dare they!}
  
  Imagine seeing your worst professional gaslighting repackaged as Emmy-nominated comedy.
  
  Imagine watching your dignity turned into a punchline between commercial breaks.
  
  So this book isn’t revenge.
  It’s just... a counterpunch.
  It is a reminder that if you're going to make jokes about startup hell, the people who 
  actually lived there deserve a little narrative justice.
